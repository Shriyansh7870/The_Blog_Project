Sharma had said, “I don’t believe in numbers. Pathaan has done exceptionally well, even KGF (Chapter 2) did extremely well, and now, Gadar 2 is performing as well. Now, let’s see how far it goes, how far the public takes it. It is the public’s film. We have already crossed Rs 400 crore, it will reach Rs 500 crore mark in the coming week and maybe the Rs 1,000 crore mark at some point. So, we are not looking at numbers alone; we are trying to make a place in people’s hearts. People are watching it and loving it; that’s enough for us. Whatever (box office) numbers have come out today are real; there is nothing fake.”'

It kills, too, and yes, it kills a lot. Joker laughs like a gimmick and then gets a little emotional.The story of a son of India who puts country before self, Pathaan is a crowd pleaser that marks the return of Shah Rukh Khan to the action genre with new toys and a lot more bombast. Returning after a hiatus, SRK is in form in the larger-than-life space of Yash Raj banner’s growing spy universe where writers pick strands from the real world and propel them at escape velocity.Siddharth focuses too much on choreographing action, often leaving emotions hanging by a thread, but it is the individual charm of the performers that makes up for the lack of strong emotional core. No wonder, early in the film, a scientist says, science is easy; love is hard.  '

It is commendable that the makers opted to forego song placements for the majority of the film, thus ensuring its momentum (although there is one song towards the end). Any musical number would have undoubtedly hindered the films pace. The daring exploits depicted in the film exude authenticity rather than a clichéd cinematic portrayal. The art direction and cinematography of this film deserve special mention, as they create a magnificent backdrop that transports viewers back to India in 1971. The sequences set in Dal Lake are breath-taking, with aerial shots capturing its beauty like never before.'

    text: "\"Pulp Fiction\" is a nonlinear crime film that weaves together multiple interconnected stories involving hitmen, crime, and unusual occurrences in Los Angeles.They took the figure of the ageing don as seriously as Lear, the careworn ruler of a secret American state-within-a-state. Stomach-turning flourishes of violence are juxtaposed with elaborate rituals of familial piety and respect, which generations of real-life criminals in the United States treated as how-to behaviour manuals for decades afterwards. These Italian-American gangsters do not complain about the bigotry heading their way, and are themselves casually racist and antisemitic. Extravagant gestures of romantic adoration and solemn respect for womenfolk are combined with casual sexual abuse; and women have to reconcile themselves to their role"

    text: "\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a drama that follows the life of a wrongly convicted inmate, Andy Dufresne, as he navigates the challenges of prison life and seeks his freedom.They took the figure of the ageing don as seriously as Lear, the careworn ruler of a secret American state-within-a-state. Stomach-turning flourishes of violence are juxtaposed with elaborate rituals of familial piety and respect, which generations of real-life criminals in the United States treated as how-to behaviour manuals for decades afterwards. These Italian-American gangsters do not complain about the bigotry heading their way, and are themselves casually racist and antisemitic. Extravagant gestures of romantic adoration and solemn respect for womenfolk are combined with casual sexual abuse; and women have to reconcile themselves to their role"
